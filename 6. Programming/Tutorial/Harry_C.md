- In C and C++, the `typedef` keyword is used to give a new name (alias) to an existing data type.(int, char, int*, struct, etc.) 
- This can improve code readability, simplify complex data types, and make code easier to maintain.
- Syntax `typedef <previous_name> <alias_name>;`

`typedef` for Inbuilt datatype
```c
#include <stdio.h>
typedef long long ll // ll : long long

int main()
{	
	typedf unsigned long ul; // ul : unsigned long
	
	ul u1, u2; // unsigned long
	ll l1, l2; // long long
	intPtr p = &value;
	return 0;
}
```

`typedef` for Structure
```c
typdef struct Student
{
	int marks;
	char name[34];
}std; // std : struct Student

// Or we could use typedef after declaring struct Student
// typedef struct Student std;
```

```c
std s1, s2; // struct Student s1, s2
s1.id = 56; 
s2. id = 89;
```

`typedef` for Pointer

```c
typedef int* intPtr // intPtr : int*
intPtr a, b; // int* a, b
int c = 89;
a = &c;
b = c;
```

# [#58 C Pre-processor Introduction & Working: C Tutorial In Hindi](https://youtu.be/P9IAfh89EK8?list=PLu0W_9lII9aiXlHcLx-mDH1Qul38wD3aR)

- Compiler converts textual form of a c program into an executable.
- There are four phases for a C program to become an executable:
```
PreProcessing -> Compilation -> Assembly -> Linking
```

1. Pre-Processing : Removal of comments, Expansion of macros, Expansion of include files
2. Compilation : Assembly level instructions are generated
3. Assembly : make `.o` or `.exe`, `printf` are not resolved , Assembly Level Instructions are converted to machine code.
4. Links the function implementations

**What is a C Pre-Processor**
- C preprocessor comes under action before the actual compilation process.
- C preprocessor is not a part of the c compiler
- It is a text substitution tool
- All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol `#`


- **`#define`**: Used to define a macro.  
- **`#include`**: Include an external header file.  
- **`#undef`**: Undefine preprocessor macros.  
- **`#ifdef`**: Check if a macro is defined (defined: 1, not defined: 0).  
- **`#ifndef`**: Check if a macro is not defined (defined: 0, not defined: 1).  
- **`#if`**: If any compile-time condition is true.  
- **`#elif`**: Alternative of `if`; if not true, then it is checked.  
- **`#else`**: Execute if no condition is true.  
- **`#endif`**: Ends a conditional preprocessor directive.  
- `#pragma`: To issue some special commands to the compiler.

Include
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
```

# [#59 `#define` and `#include`Â Preprocessor Directives: C Tutorial In Hindi](https://youtu.be/qDIpHL8Al20?list=PLu0W_9lII9aiXlHcLx-mDH1Qul38wD3aR)

- The `#include` directive causes the preprocessor to fetch the contents of some other file to be included in the present file
- This file may in turn `#include` some other file(s) which may in turn do the same. Most commonly the `#inlcuded` files have a "`.h`" extension, indicating that they are header files.

### `#Include`
```
mostly header files have promises i.e. is function prototypes.
```

In C programming there are two common formats for `#includes`:
- `#include < headerFiIe.h >` // The angle brackets say to look in the standard system directories
- `#include " myFile.h"` // The quotation marks say to look in the current directory.

Disk drive full path is allowed, but discouraged since it is not portable:
- `#include <C:\Program Files\Harry\bhai\somefile.h >` // Too specific
- `#include <sys/file.h>` // Relative and portable path to the standard locations.

### `#define`

- The `#define` directive is used to "define" preprocessor "variables"
- The `#define` preprocessor directive can be used to globally replace a word with a number.
- It acts as if an editor did a global search-and-replace edit of the file.
```
#define PI 3.141
```

`#define` for Debugging
- `#define` directive can be used for debugging 
- We can have printing statements that we only want active when debugging.
- We can "protect" them in a "`ifdef`" block as follows:
```
#define DEBUG
#ifdef DEBUG {print statement...}
#endif ...
#undef DEBUG

```

Macros using `#define`
- We can create macros using `#define`
- Macros operate much like functions, but because they are expanded in place and are generally faster
```
#define SQUARE(x) x*x
float PI = 3.141
area = PI * SQUARE (radius);
```

Notes: Macros are resolved at, preprocessing and so faster and efficient than functions.

`#Include` directive
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "Tutorial2.c"  // contain functionDangling();

int main()
{
	int *ptr = functionDangling(); // from `Tutorial2.c` file
	return 0;
}
```

`#Define` directive
```c
# define PI 3.141

int main()
{
	float var = PI;
	printf("The value of PI is %f\n", var); // 3.141
	return 0;
}
```

`#define` Macros
```c
#define SQUARE(r) r*r

int main()
{
	int r = 4;
	printf("The area of this circle is %f\n", PI*SQUARE(r));
}
```

# [#60 Predefined Macros & Other Pre-processor Directives: C Tutorial In Hindi](https://youtu.be/iOTf_ZgrU20)


- Preprocessor is a kind of automated editor that modifies a copy of the original source code 
- The `#include` directive causes the preprocessor to fetch the contents of some other file to be included in the present file
- In C programming there are two common formats for `#includes`
- This  file may in turn `#include` some other file(s) which may in turn do the same.
- Most commonly the `#include` files have a "`.h`" extension, indicating that they are header files.
- The `#define` directive is used to "`define`" preprocessor "`variables`"

### Predefined Macros in C

1. `__DATE__`: The current date as character literal in "MMM DD YYYY" format
2. 1. `__TIME__`: This contains the current time as a character literal in "HH:MM:SS" format.
3. 1. `__FILE__`: The current filename as a string literal.
4. 1. `__LINE__`: The current line number as a decimal constant.
5. 1. `__STDC__`: Define as 1(one) when the compiler complies with the ANSI standard.

```c
int main()
{
 printf("FILE name is %s\n", __FILE__ ); // tutorial60.c
 printf("Today's Date is %s\n", __DATE__); // Oct 06 2024
 printf("Time Now is %s\n", __TIME__); // 12:16:31
 printf("Line No. is %d\n", __LINE__); // 7
 printf("ANSI: %d\n", __STDC__); // 1 
}
```
