The output you provided shows the available NPM scripts in your `react-markdown-editor` project. Here's what each script does:

1. **`npm start`**: Runs the development server. This is the command you'll use most often when developing. It starts your app in development mode with hot reloading.

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **`npm test`**: Runs the test suite. It will find and execute any tests you have written using Jest (which is bundled with `react-scripts`).

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. **`npm run build`**: Bundles the app into static files for production. The output is optimized and minified, and this is the command you would run when preparing your app for deployment.

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **`npm run eject`**: Ejects the app, which means it will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (like Webpack and Babel) directly into your project. After ejecting, you will have full control over the configuration, but you lose the ability to easily upgrade `react-scripts`.

   ```bash
   npm run eject
   ```

To start the development server and work on your project, you would typically run:

```bash
npm start
```

If you encounter any issues or need to perform other actions, you can use the other commands as needed.
